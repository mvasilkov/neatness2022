# [The Neatness][1]

> A walk through life, however thorough,<br>
> Ends on a hill a bit too steep.<br>
> Bear witness, not to strife and sorrow, –<br>
> Bare neatness of eternal sleep.<br>

If you feel it's too easy, try the Coil levels from the
level select screen. They are cursedly hard.
(If you don't have Coil, append `#coil` to the URL.)

For best experience on Android, use the 'Add to Home screen'
feature. Seriously, it's amazing how much better the game runs
if started from that shortcut.
