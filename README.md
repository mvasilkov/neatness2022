If you feel it's too easy, try the Coil levels from the
level select screen. They are cursedly hard.
(If you don't have Coil, append `#coil` to the URL.)

For best experience on Android, use the 'Add to Home screen'
feature. Seriously, it's amazing how much better the game runs
if started from that shortcut.

Thank you for playing!
